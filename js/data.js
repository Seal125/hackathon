    description:`In the early 1950s, the U.S. Navy sought a jet-powered replacement for the large, piston-engined AD-1 Skyraider. Noted aircraft designer Edward Henry “Ed" Heinemann and his team at Douglas Aircraft Company designed the versatile A-4 Skyhawk.
The Skyhawk's key feature was its small delta-shaped wing. With a span of only 27.5 feet (8.4 m), the wings did not require folding for hangar deck storage. Eliminating heavy and complex wing-folding mechanisms saved weight. All ordnance, as well as extra fuel, was carried externally on racks under the wings and central fuselage. The Skyhawk could also be configured as a “buddy tanker." Carrying extra fuel tanks and a central pod with a retractable hose system, the Skyhawk refueled other aircraft in flight.

Seven different squadrons flew Skyhawks from Intrepid during its three combat deployments to Vietnam between 1966 and 1969. Typical missions for the Skyhawk included lightly armed surveillance and heavily loaded strikes on strategic targets. Some large strikes on high-priority targets, called alpha strikes, included aircraft from multiple aircraft carriers, which flew in coordination with U.S. Air Force bombers. On these missions, some of the Skyhawks served as flak suppressors. Flak suppressors attacked the anti-aircraft emplacements around the primary target rather than the target itself.
The A-4B Skyhawk displayed here flew with attack squadron VA-95 during Intrepid's first deployment to Vietnam in 1966. It has been restored to its original appearance.

    description:`During World War II, the electric-powered gun turrets found on American bombers enabled quicker, more stable gunner reflex and response and, in theory, greater gunner accuracy. The Grumman TBF/TBM Avenger displayed across from this exhibit was the first American naval plane to employ such a turret.
This Avenger ball turret is electrically powered and can traverse horizontally 360 degrees in either direction. The ball and gun can be raised 85 degrees above horizontal and depressed 30 degrees below horizontal. The turret is supplied with safety switches to prevent accidentally shooting off the wings and tail surfaces of the aircraft.
Armor plate protects the gunner, who sits inside the turret. The armor consists of 42 inch (12.7 mm) plate in the front and on the sides, a 14 inch (6.4 mm) armor plate footrest under the seat, and 142 inch (38.1 mm) laminated bulletproof glass in front of the gunners face.

{ description:`First flown in 1941 and introduced operationally in June 1942, the Avenger became the U.S. Navy's standard torpedo bomber throughout World War II, with more than 9,836 constructed. Designed and built by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, they were affectionately nicknamed “turkeys" for their somewhat ungainly appearance. Avengers flew off Intrepid throughout her World War Il career. In the Pacific theater, Avengers participated in the sinking of some of the most powerful warships in the Japanese fleet including the battleships Yamato and Musashi. Perhaps the most famous Avenger pilot was President George H. W. Bush who in 1944, despite aircraft damage and the loss of his crew, successfully piloted his Avenger in an attack on a Japanese radio station on Chichi Jima, an island south of Japan.
The Eastern TBM-3E Avenger displayed here was actually built in a General Motors plant. It is armed with a Mark 13 torpedo, the first U.S. Navy torpedo designed to be launched from airplanes.

Fact: At the conclusion of their military careers, many Avengers soldiered on as fire fighting water bombers for many years, thanks to their reliability and load-carrying ability.

{description:`When first built. Intrepid had more than 100 anti-aircraft guns. The short-range 20mm Oerlikon gun was the ship's last line of defense against enemy aircraft. These guns could fire 450 rounds per minute at a maximum effective range of 1,000 yards (914 meters).
On October 29, 1944, a Japanese kamikaze aircraft crashed into Gun Tub 10. Located just aft of the port side aircraft elevator, the gun tub had six 20mm guns like this one. The gunners were black stewards and stewards' mates whose regular assignments included serving officers in their wardroom. When the ship was under attack, they manned their battle station in Gun Tub 10. During the kamikaze attack, they courageously fired position, killing ten men. their guns as the Japanese airplane crashed into their position, killing ten men.
Six of the surviving gunners were awarded the Bronze Star for valor. Alonzo Swann maintained that he and his shipmates had been promised a higher honor, the Navy Cross, but they instead received the lesser award due to discrimination. In 1993, Swann finally received the Navy Cross in a ceremony at the Intrepid Museum.

{description:`Frank Piasecki, aeronautical engineer and one of America's helicopter pioneers, designed the Piasecki HUP/UH-25 Retriever specifically for the Navy in 1948. Unlike other Piaseckis, which could carry up to 40 passengers, his HUP/UH-25 was a small, six-passenger helicopter. Its rotors overlap and are small enough to fit on aircraft carrier elevators without having to fold or collapse the rotor blades. For storage on carrier hangar decks the blades could easily be folded, making this helicopter a very small, flexible workhorse. The HUP was used mostly as a utility helicopter and for aerial rescue—an electric onboard hoist and large floor hatch enabled a pilot to easily lift downed aviators.

Facts: The HUP-2 was the first helicopter to have an autopilot. HUP production for the Navy and Army, as well as the Canadian and French navies, totaled 339 helicopters.

    description:`Ship’s bells are used to mark the passage of time. Dividing the day into four-hour “watches”, or periods of duty. Each strike of the bell signifies the end of a half-hour, and the bell is sounded in pairs for easier counting. The maximum number of bells is eight, which indicates the end of one watch and the start of the next.
The Intrepids original bronze bell, displayed here, was replaced with another bell that is displayed at the aft end of Hangar 2.`,

GRUMMAN BALL TURRET
During World War II, the electric-powered gun turrets found on American bombers enabled quicker, more stable gunner reflex and response and, in theory, greater gunner accuracy. The Grumman TBF/TBM Avenger displayed across from this exhibit was the first American naval plane to employ such a turret.
This Avenger ball turret is electrically powered and can traverse horizontally 360 degrees in either direction. The ball and gun can be raised 85 degrees above horizontal and depressed 30 degrees below horizontal. The turret is supplied with safety switches to prevent accidentally shooting off the wings and tail surfaces of the aircraft.
Armor plate protects the gunner, who sits inside the turret. The armor consists of 42 inch (12.7 mm) plate in the front and on the sides, a 14 inch (6.4 mm) armor plate footrest under the seat, and 142 inch (38.1 mm) laminated bulletproof glass in front of the gunners face.

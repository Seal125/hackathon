MK 10 MOD 0 OPTICAL LANDING SYSTEM
The optical landing system helped aviators find the correct gide path as they approached Intrepid for landing.
During World War II, an aircraft carrier's Landing Signal Officer (LSO) stood on a platform at the edge of the flight deck and waved colored paddles as pilots approached the carrier. His signals helped pilots adjust their glide path for a safe landing.
As aircraft landing speeds increased in the jet age, the optical landing system replaced the paddle-waving LSO. This device was mounted at the edge of the flight deck. A source light, mounted farther aft, was shone into the
mirror. Approaching pilots would see this “ball” of light in the mirror, earning the device the nickname “meatball." The position of the ball relative to the row of green lights on either side indicated if the plane was on the correct glide path. If the ball was higher or lower than the green lights, the pilot was too high or too low. If the ball was in line with the lights, the pilot was on the right path.
The “meatball" displayed here is a land-based model used to train naval aviators at Naval Air Stations for the challenges of carrier landings.
A pilot landing aboard Intrepid in the late 1950s took this photo, which shows the meatball on the port (left) side of Intrepids flight deck. (U.S. Navy)

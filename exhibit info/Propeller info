PROPELLER
Intrepid's four propellers moved the ship through the seas. Intrepid could reach maximum speeds approaching 32 knots, or more than 37 mph (59.5 kph). Today's aircraft carriers - the ships of the Nimitz class - travel at about the same speed.
Intrepid's power plant could generate close to 150,000 horsepower, four steam turbines driven by eight boilers turned the ship's four propeller shafts. Each bronze propeller weighs approximately 27,000 pounds (12,247 kg). or roughly the equivalent of ten automobiles.
In November 2006, Intrepid was scheduled to be towed away from pier 86 for repair work. When a team of Tugboats first attempted to tow Intrepid, she did not budge. Her propellers were lodged in the mud at the bottom of the Hudson River. After emergency dredging, tugboats managed to pull intrepid free a month later. All four of Intrepids propellers were removed when she was dry docked in 2007.

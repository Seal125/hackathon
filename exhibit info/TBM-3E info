GRUMMAN/EASTERN AIRCRAFT TBM-3E AVENGER
First flown in 1941 and introduced operationally in June 1942, the Avenger became the U.S. Navy's standard torpedo bomber throughout World War II, with more than 9,836 constructed. Designed and built by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, they were affectionately nicknamed â€œturkeys" for their somewhat ungainly appearance. Avengers flew off Intrepid throughout her World War Il career. In the Pacific theater, Avengers participated in the sinking of some of the most powerful warships in the Japanese fleet including the battleships Yamato and Musashi. Perhaps the most famous Avenger pilot was President George H. W. Bush who in 1944, despite aircraft damage and the loss of his crew, successfully piloted his Avenger in an attack on a Japanese radio station on Chichi Jima, an island south of Japan.
The Eastern TBM-3E Avenger displayed here was actually built in a General Motors plant. It is armed with a Mark 13 torpedo, the first U.S. Navy torpedo designed to be launched from airplanes.

Fact: At the conclusion of their military careers, many Avengers soldiered on as fire fighting water bombers for many years, thanks to their reliability and load-carrying ability.

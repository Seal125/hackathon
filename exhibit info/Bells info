THE INTREPID'S BELL
Ship’s bells are used to mark the passage of time. Dividing the day into four-hour “watches”, or periods of duty. Each strike of the bell signifies the end of a half-hour, and the bell is sounded in pairs for easier counting. The maximum number of bells is eight, which indicates the end of one watch and the start of the next.
The Intrepids original bronze bell, displayed here, was replaced with another bell that is displayed at the aft end of Hangar 2.

On October 29, 1944, a Japanese kamikaze aircraft crashed into Gun Tub 10. Located just aft of the port side aircraft elevator, the gun tub had six 20mm guns like this one. The gunners were black stewards and stewards' mates whose regular assignments included serving officers in their wardroom. When the ship was under attack, they manned their battle station in Gun Tub 10. During the kamikaze attack, they courageously fired position, killing ten men. their guns as the Japanese airplane crashed into their position, killing ten men.
Six of the surviving gunners were awarded the Bronze Star for valor. Alonzo Swann maintained that he and his shipmates had been promised a higher honor, the Navy Cross, but they instead received the lesser award due to discrimination. In 1993, Swann finally received the Navy Cross in a ceremony at the Intrepid Museum.

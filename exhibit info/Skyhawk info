DOUGLAS (A4D-2) A-4B SKYHAWK
In the early 1950s, the U.S. Navy sought a jet-powered replacement for the large, piston-engined AD-1 Skyraider. Noted aircraft designer Edward Henry “Ed" Heinemann and his team at Douglas Aircraft Company designed the versatile A-4 Skyhawk.
The Skyhawk's key feature was its small delta-shaped wing. With a span of only 27.5 feet (8.4 m), the wings did not require folding for hangar deck storage. Eliminating heavy and complex wing-folding mechanisms saved weight. All ordnance, as well as extra fuel, was carried externally on racks under the wings and central fuselage. The Skyhawk could also be configured as a “buddy tanker." Carrying extra fuel tanks and a central pod with a retractable hose system, the Skyhawk refueled other aircraft in flight.

Seven different squadrons flew Skyhawks from Intrepid during its three combat deployments to Vietnam between 1966 and 1969. Typical missions for the Skyhawk included lightly armed surveillance and heavily loaded strikes on strategic targets. Some large strikes on high-priority targets, called alpha strikes, included aircraft from multiple aircraft carriers, which flew in coordination with U.S. Air Force bombers. On these missions, some of the Skyhawks served as flak suppressors. Flak suppressors attacked the anti-aircraft emplacements around the primary target rather than the target itself.
The A-4B Skyhawk displayed here flew with attack squadron VA-95 during Intrepid's first deployment to Vietnam in 1966. It has been restored to its original appearance.

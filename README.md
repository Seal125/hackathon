### What is the name of your project?    
Intrepid Explorer
### What does this project do?
This project allows you to explore the intrepid in the comfort of your own home, along with text-to-speech that makes the experience feel like a tour! Exhibits and information are all displayed, along with images of the exhibits themselves.
### Who did you design this project for?
We designed this project for everyone and anyone who is interested in exploring the historical ship, and if you didn't feel like taking a trip to the Intrepid in person or couldn't, then this explorer is perfect!
### What was your inspiration for this project?
The major inspiration for this was the concept of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy's guide, which contained information about many of the galaxy's species, planets, and much more. We simply wanted to give others a delightful, educational experience from history.
### What challenges did you run into?
Matching the images/info of the exhibits to each indvidual page
Making a functioning search bar and also learning about template literal.
Creating a system that is intutive to use and scalable.

Finding a good style for all the pages

A changes I was making the Intrepid move in the mine game

My challenge was creating the audio for the text-to-speech. -Stephanie
### What accomplishments are you most proud of?
Getting our project to actually function
Im proud of our team work and how much communication went into it  
I'm proud of getting the audio to work somewhat, although in the end, something happened to prohibit that. -Stephanie
I am happy with how the map turned out and I can more if I wanted too
### What did your team learn?
We learned that we need to coordinate our work better as otherwise our changes can make other member's code malfunction.
I learned how to work as a team / unit also learned more about javascript. 
I believe we learned that collaborating and helping each other would definitely benefit from this experience, and in order to maintain a job well done, this is essential. -Stephanie
